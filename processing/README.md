# attendance-project
attendance project using I.A.

Hi, this is a project to track the attendance given a group of ppl.

How it should be used?

Well, first u need to register some "faces" using the register.py script. Then you just have to run attendance.py script and be sure that its working just fine and
capturing frames.

It'll log all attendances inside attendance.csv file.
